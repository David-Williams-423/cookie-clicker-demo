# Cookie Clicker Demo

Welcome to the Cookie Clicker Demo repository! This project was created as a demonstration for the "Introduction to SwiftUI" workshop at HackNC. I led this workshop representing App Team Carolina, a student-run club that develops apps.

## Overview

This demo showcases a simple cookie clicker game built using SwiftUI. Users can click on a cookie to increase their cookie count and purchase upgrades to enhance their cookie-clicking experience.

### Features

1. **Main Game Interface** - The primary game interface displays the cookie that users can click on to increase their cookie count. The interface also showcases the total number of cookies the user has. [View Code](https://github.com/David-Williams-423/cookie-clicker-demo/blob/main/Cookie%20Clicker%20Demo/ContentView.swift)

2. **Upgrades** - Users can purchase upgrades to enhance their cookie-clicking experience. Each upgrade has its unique power and price. [View Code](https://github.com/David-Williams-423/cookie-clicker-demo/blob/main/Cookie%20Clicker%20Demo/Upgrade.swift)

3. **Upgrade View** - A separate view where users can see and purchase available upgrades. [View Code](https://github.com/David-Williams-423/cookie-clicker-demo/blob/main/Cookie%20Clicker%20Demo/UpgradeView.swift)

4. **Home View Model** - The logic behind the main game interface, including the cookie click functionality and the addition of upgrades. [View Code](https://github.com/David-Williams-423/cookie-clicker-demo/blob/main/Cookie%20Clicker%20Demo/HomeViewModel.swift)

5. **App Entry Point** - The main entry point of the app. [View Code](https://github.com/David-Williams-423/cookie-clicker-demo/blob/main/Cookie%20Clicker%20Demo/Cookie_Clicker_DemoApp.swift)
